# MythiqueQue

## Usage ##

When the bot enters your Discord guild (server). You should have a TextChannel named `channelName` (here: "mythic-queue") and a TextChannel named "mythic-annonce".

The bot will then automatically send a message to the channel `channelName` with 3 reactions:
:shield: (for tanks), ⛑️ (for heals), :crossed_swords: (for DPS).

At the moment you can only tag in one role. 

**To tag**

Simply react to the emoji corresponding the role you want to play

**To cancel tag**

Simply remove your react to the emoji corresponding to the role you wanted to play

**To view who's in queue**

Type `+filè  in any channel where the bot is in. It will send you a DM with the list of players in the queue.

When the group is complete the bot will send a message in the channel "mythic-annonce" tagging the member of the made group and removing their reactions.
